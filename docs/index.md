# Introduction

GenomeSpy is a toolkit for interactive visualization of genomic and other data.
It enables tailored visualizations by providing a declarative
[grammar](grammar/index.md), which allows for mapping data to visual channels
(position, color, etc.) and composing complex visualization from primitive
graphical marks ([points](grammar/mark/point.md),
[rectangles](grammar/mark/rect.md), etc.). The grammar is heavily inspired by
[Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/), providing partial compatibility
and extending it with features essential in genome visualization.

The visualizations are rendered using a carefully crafted WebGL-based engine,
enabling fluid interaction and smooth animation for datasets comprising several
million data points. The high interactive performance is achieved using GPU
[shader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader) programs for all
[scale](grammar/scale.md) transformations and rendering of marks. However,
shaders are an implementation detail hidden from the end users.

The toolkit comprises two JavaScript packages:

1. The [**core**](grammar/index.md) library implements the visualization grammar
   and rendering engine and can be embedded in web pages or applications.
2. The [**app**](sample-collections/index.md) extends the core library with support
   for interactive analysis of large sample collections. It broadens the grammar
   by introducing a facet operator that repeats a visualization for multiple
   samples. The app also provides interactions for filtering, sorting, and
   grouping these samples.

Check the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) page to get started with
GenomeSpy and make your own tailored visualizations.
