# Visualization Grammar

Genome browser applications typically couple the visual representations to
specific file formats and provide few customization options. GenomeSpy has a
more abstract approach to visualization, providing combinatorial building blocks
such as [marks](mark/point.md), [transformations](transform/), and
[scales](scale.md). As a result, users can author tailored visualizations that
display the underlying data more effectively.

The concept was first introduced in [The Grammar of
Graphics](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387245447) and developer further
in [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) and
[Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/).

!!! note "A subset of Vega-Lite"

    The visualization grammar of GenomeSpy is a subset and a dialect of
    [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/). However, the goals of
    GenomeSpy and Vega-Lite are different â€“ GenomeSpy is more domain specific
    and is intended for visualization and analysis of large datasets that
    contain genomic coordinates. GenomeSpy tries to faithfully follow
    Vega-Lite's grammar where practical. Thus, this documentation has many
    references to its documentation.

## A single view specification

Each view specification must have at least the `data` to be visualized, the
`mark` that will represent the data items, and an `encoding` that specifies how
the fields of data are mapped to the visual channels of the mark. In addition,
an optional `transform` steps allow for modifying the data before they are
encoded into mark instances.

TODO: Document the supported properties. Meanwhile, have a look at Vega-Lite's
[view specification](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/spec.html)
documentation, as many of the properties (e.g., width/height, title, etc.) are
supported in GenomeSpy.

## More complex visualizations with view composition

View [composition](composition/index.md) allows for building more complex
visualizations from multiple view specifications. For example, the
[`layer`](composition/layer.md) operator enables creation of custom glyphs and
the [concatenation](composition/concat.md) operators allow stacked layouts
resembling genome browsers with multiple tracks.

TODO: Write about inheritance of `data` and `encoding`.
