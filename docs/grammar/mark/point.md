# Point

Point mark displays each data item as a symbol. Points are often used to create
a scatter plot. In the genomic context, they could represent, for example,
point mutations at genomic loci.

## Channels

In addition to standard [position](./index.md#channels) channels and
`color`, `opacity`, and `strokeWidth` channels, point mark has the following
channels:

`size`
: Type: Number

    The area of the point in pixels. In practice, the area is less because
    the shapes do not fill their rectangular container. Example: the diameter
    of a circle with the size of `100` is 10 (sqrt(100)) pixels.

    **Default value:** `100`

`shape`
: Type: String

    One of `"circle"`, `"square"`, `"cross"`, `"diamond"`, `"triangle-up"`,
    `"triangle-down"`, `"triangle-right"`, or `"triangle-left"`.

    **Default value:** `"circle"`

`dx`
: Type: Number

    The horizontal offset between the text and its anchor point, in pixels.
    Applied after the rotation by `angle`.

    **Default value:** `0`

`dy`
: Type: Number

    The vertical offset between the text and its anchor point, in pixels.
    Applied after the rotation by `angle`.

    **Default value:** `0`

## Properties

`fillGradientStrength`
: Type: Number

    Gradient strength controls the amount of the gradient eye-candy effect.
    Valid values are between `0` and `1`.

    **Default value:** `0`

`geometricZoomBound`
: Type: Number

    Enables [geometric zooming](#geometric-zoom).
    The value is the base two logarithmic zoom level where the maximum point
    size is reached.

    **Default value:** `0`

`sampleFacetPadding`
: Type: Number

    A special property for the [GenomeSpy app](../../sample-collections/visualizing.md).

    Padding between sample facet's upper/lower edge and the maximum point size. This property
    controls how tightly points are squeezed when facet's height is smaller than the maximum
    point size. The unit is a proportion of facet's height. The value must be between `0`
    and `0.5`. This property has no effect when sample faceting is not used.

    **Default value:** `0.1`

## Examples

### Plenty of points

The example below demonstrates how points can be varied by using
`shape`, `fill`, `size`, `strokeWidth`, and `angle` channels.

    }
  }
}

## Zoom behavior

Although points are infinitely small on the real number line, they have a
specific diameter on the screen. Thus, closely located points tend to overlap
each other. Decreasing the point size reduces the probability of overlap, but
in a zoomed-in view, the plot may become overly sparse.

To control overplotting, the point mark provides two zooming behaviors that
adjust the point size and visibility based on the zoom level.

### Geometric zoom

Geometric zoom scales the point size down if the current zoom level is lower
than the specified level (bound). `geometricZoomBound` mark property enables
geometric zooming. The value is the negative base two logarithm of the
relative width of the visible domain. Example: `0`: (the default) full-size
points are always shown, `1`: when a half of the domain is visible, `2`: when
a quarter is visible, and so on.

The example below displays 200 000 semi-randomly generated points. The points
reach their full size when 1 / 2^10.5 of the domain is visible, which equals
about 1500X zoom.

      "as": "y"
    }

    "y": { "field": "y", "type": "quantitative" },

    "opacity": { "value": 0.6 }
  }
}
```

!!! tip

    You can use geometric zoom to improve rendering performance. Smaller points
    are faster to render than large points.

### Semantic zoom

The score-based semantic zoom adjusts the point visibility by coupling a score
threshold to current zoom level. The `semanticScore` channel enables the
semantic zoom and specifies the score field. The `semanticZoomFraction` property
controls the fraction of data items to show in the fully zoomed-out view, i.e.,
it specifies the threshold score. The fraction is scaled as the viewport is
zoomed. Thus, if the data is distributed roughly uniformly along the zoomed
axis, roughly constant number of points are visible at all zoom levels. The
score can be _arbitrarily distributed_, as the threshold is computed using
_p_-quantiles.

The example below has 200 000 semi-randomly generated points with an
exponentially distributed score. As the view is zoomed in, new points appear.
Their number in the viewport stays approximately constant until the lowest
possible score has been reached.

{
  "data": {
    "sequence": { "start": 0, "stop": 200000, "as": "x" }
  },

    { "type": "formula", "expr": "random() * 0.682", "as": "u" },
    {
      "type": "formula",
      "expr": "((datum.u % 1e-8 > 5e-9 ? 1 : -1) * (sqrt(-log(max(1e-9, datum.u))) - 0.618)) * 1.618",
      "as": "y"
    },
    {
      "type": "formula",
      "expr": "-log(random())",
      "as": "score"
    }
  ],

    "type": "point",
    "semanticZoomFraction": 0.002

      "field": "score",
      "type": "quantitative",
      "scale": { "range": [0.1, 1] }
    },
    "semanticScore": { "field": "score", "type": "quantitative" },
    "size": { "value": 100 }
  }
}
```

!!! tip

    The score-based semantic zoom is great for filtering point mutations and
    indels that are scored using [CADD](https://cadd.gs.washington.edu/),
    for example.
