# Example Specifications

This directory contains some random view specification that can be accessed
through urls like `http://localhost:8080/?spec=examples/first.json` when you
launch GenomeSpy using the `npm start` command.

If you want to play with specifications but don't want to add them to the
version control, put them to `../../private/` directory instead. It is in
`.gitignore` and is accessible at `http://localhost:8080/?spec=private/foo.json`.
