# GenomeSpy

![Teaser](docs/img/teaser.png)

GenomeSpy is a visualization toolkit for genomic (and other) data. It has a Vega-Lite inspired visualization grammar and high-performance WebGL-powered graphics.

The software is still work in progress. Documentation and examples of an early alpha version can be found at https://genomespy.app/

## Bootstrapping and running

1. `git clone git@github.com:tuner/genome-spy.git`
2. `cd genome-spy`
3. `npm install` (use npm7!)
4. `npm start`

The `packages/genome-spy/static/examples` directory contains some random view specification that can be accessed through urls like `http://localhost:8080/?spec=examples/first.json`.

The `packages/genome-spy/private/` directory is in `.gitignore` and served by the development server: `http://localhost:8080/?spec=private/foo.json`. Use it for experiments that should not go into version control.
